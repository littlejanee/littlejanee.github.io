feedback template: 
"design principles - template.pdf" includes our list of design principles and definitions, etc. that compose our feedback templates. The templates also include corresponding issues (customizable text for specific instances of the issues), "prominence" criteria for determining if an issue is prominent enough to be identified as an issue, issue explanations, and recommendations for addressing that category of issues. If an identified issue is deemed prominent in the user's design, the Wizards will customize the specific instance templates according to the participant's design, annotate a location, and then submit the issue identification. Once the interviewer publishes the feedback, the user will see a purple notification dot on the "Request Feedback" button notifying them that feedback is available. Upon expanding the issue, the participant will see the specific instance and the other corresponding issue content as shown in this table.

"design principles - reference.pdf" is a simplified version of our feedback template table with only the "principle" -> "explanation" columns. This is shared with the participants as a learning reference for the pre- and post-tests.
