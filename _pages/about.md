\[**next**\] I will be starting at [NUS Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg) as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2025 and will be recruiting students in the upcoming year. Prior to that, I will be postdocing at [Stanford HAI](https://hai.stanford.edu), mentored by my PhD advisor [James Landay](https://www.landay.org/), while starting as an Adjunct Professor at NUS and an affiliate with the [Smart Systems Institute](https://ssi.nus.edu.sg/).

\[**past**\] I just finished my postdoc at [The Design Lab @ UCSD](https://designlab.ucsd.edu/meet-member-of-postdoctoral-fellowship-programs-debut-cohort-jane-e/) as part of the debut cohort of [UCSD CSE’s Postdoctoral Fellows Program](https://twitter.com/ucsd_cse/status/1352343609417166849), where I was mentored by [Haijun Xia](https://creativity.ucsd.edu/) and [Steven Dow](https://protolab.ucsd.edu/). Prior to that, I graduated from Stanford University with a PhD in Computer Science where I was coadvised by [James Landay](https://www.landay.org/) and [Pat Hanrahan](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~hanrahan/).

\[**research**\] My research lies primarily at the intersection of human computer interaction and computer graphics. Broadly, I'm interested in thinking about how to design computational tools that can support users in developing domain expertise, which I currently explore within the domain of creativity. My work takes inspiration from cognitive science and education theory to design computational tools that scaffold novices’ creative processes. Inspired by how expert artists have trained their eyes to "see" in a certain way, I aim to design guidance that helps novices develop their own "artistic vision"---and in doing so, support them in developing their own artistic expertise.

<!--More specifically, my dissertation work focused on photography and videography interfaces. I designed in-camera guidance interfaces that can help users be more aware of their artistic choices. During my postdoc, I am more directly exploring the impact of computational feedback on creativity to inform the design of such creativity support tools. 

Broadly I am interested in using computation to provide scaffolding that can encourage novices to develop their own artistic expertise as they are performing creative tasks. Earlier on in my PhD, I also did some work looking at natural human-drone interaction.-->

<!-- I am grateful for the support that funded much of my PhD research. I was fortunate to have been supported for several years by the [Brown Institute for Media Innovation](http://brown.columbia.edu/) through a Brown Fellowship and several Magic Grants. I was also supported for a year by the [Hasso Plattner Institute-Stanford Design Thinking Research Program](https://hpi.de/en/dtrp/program/overview.html) and was one of the 2018 [Microsoft Research Dissertation Grant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/microsoft-research-dissertation-grants-broadening-the-phd-pipeline-to-increase-innovation/) recipients. In 2015, I was supported by a Microsoft Research Women's Fellowship.

I graduated in June 2012 from Princeton University with a Bachelors in Computer Science and a Certificate in Applied and Computational Mathematics. After college, I worked as a Software Development Engineer for two years on the Photos and Videos (Apps for Creative Expressions) team at Microsoft. -->


\[**other**\] On the side, I am a dancer 🩰 and a photo enthusiast 📷. I am a foodie 🍛 and also a lover of fitness 🤸🏻‍♀️.
